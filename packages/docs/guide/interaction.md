# Interaction & Responsive Design

In Macaron, you can make components interactive (hover effect etc) and responsive (media queries) by adding a **variant** to a component.

A variant is a visual state that is applied to a component. The condition for a variant can be CSS selectors (for the root element of the component) or media queries.

## Create a variant

To create a variant, select the component or the default variant, click the top-left **+** button in the **Component** tab in the side bar.

A variant with the `:hover` pseudo-class will be added. You can change the selectors/media queries in the **Conditions** panel.
